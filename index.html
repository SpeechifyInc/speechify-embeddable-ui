      content="Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. This process is crucial for life on Earth as it provides the primary source of energy for nearly all organisms. During photosynthesis, chlorophyll in the chloroplasts absorbs light energy, which drives the synthesis of glucose from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This process not only supports the growth of plants but also maintains atmospheric oxygen levels."
